    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "     MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans:-MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON).\n",
    "     It is designed to handle unstructured data and offers high scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database that does not use the traditional relational \n",
    "    data model used by SQL databases. Instead, they use a variety of data models such as document, key-value, column-family, \n",
    "    and graph to store and manipulate data. Non-relational databases are generally more flexible and scalable than SQL databases, \n",
    "    making them suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flexibility and scalability are key requirements: MongoDB allows you to store unstructured data without the need for predefined schemas,\n",
    "    making it easy to adapt to changing requirements. It also offers horizontal scalability through sharding, which allows you to distribute \n",
    "    data across multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Performance is critical: MongoDB's document-oriented data model and efficient indexing mechanisms make it faster than SQL databases for\n",
    "    certain types of queries, such as those involving complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Real-time analytics are required: MongoDB's ability to handle real-time streaming data and its support for aggregation pipelines make \n",
    "    it well-suited for real-time analytics use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cloud-based deployment is preferred: MongoDB's cloud-based deployment options, including its Atlas cloud service,\n",
    "    make it easy to deploy and manage databases in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overall, MongoDB is a powerful NoSQL database that is well-suited for handling large volumes of unstructured data, real-time analytics,\n",
    "    and cloud-based deployment scenarios."

    "    6. Automatic sharding: MongoDB's automatic sharding feature allows you to distribute data across multiple nodes without manual intervention.\n",
    "    7. Replication and failover: MongoDB supports automatic replication and failover, ensuring high availability and data durability.\n",
    "    8. ACID transactions: MongoDB now supports multi-document ACID transactions. \n",
